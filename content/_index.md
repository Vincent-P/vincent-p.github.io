Welcome to my personal blog!

I'm Vincent, a self-taught graphic programmer. A few years ago I started learning graphics programming using Vulkan.
At first it was very difficult, but thanks to my experience in the game industry, the great people in the graphics community on Twitter, and a lot of talks on SIGGRAPH/GDC, I started to get the hang of it.

I'll try to share some of my knowledge here, hopefully my articles will make sense to you!
